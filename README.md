# fetch-api
### By Evan Burton
## NASA Epic API
- Initialized repo and set up fetch for the nasa api get src https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/api/natural
- Had difficulty initially figuring out how to get data from the array, provided... remembered once it was in an array i could specify the desired object in the array.
- Difficulty getting pictures to load initially, had to read through the NASA API walkthrough before I realized the image portion of the data was just a signifier for where you need to pull the data from eg. https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov /archive 	/natural 	/2016 	/10 	/31 	/png 	epic_1b_20161031xxxx.png. The epic_1b being the signifier in the data field.
